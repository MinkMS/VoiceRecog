## This is my testing project about vietnamese speech recognition. 
## It uses the doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h dataset from hugging face. Here's its link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h

#### This program is recommended to run on a device with GPU (don't use CPU like me pls). It iss also recommended that you have more than 60Gb in C:\ when run thiss code to store the cache from training.

###### I didn't really succeed in training the model because of device problem (yes, even google collab couldn't do it, session timeout). I still didn't know what to do with this model, I'll consider it later.
###### It is my very first serious project, and I don't have any experience in this.
