## Our testing project about vietnamese speech recognition. It uses the doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h dataset from hugging face. Here's its link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h

#### This program is recommended to run on a device with GPU (don't use CPU like us pls). It is also recommended that you have more than 60Gb in C:\ when run thiss code to store the cache from training.

###### We didn't really succeed in training the model because of device problem (yes, even google collab couldn't do it, session timeout). We still didn't know what to do with this model, we'll consider it later.
###### It is our very first serious project, and we don't have any experience in this.
###### Required libs: torchaudio datasets matplotlib librosa
